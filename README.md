SVM Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs
This repository demonstrates image classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

Overview:
In this project, we utilize SVM from scikit-learn along with OpenCV to preprocess and classify images of cats and dogs. The steps include loading images, resizing them to a fixed size, converting them to grayscale, and flattening them into 1D arrays for SVM input.

Files:
Task_3.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluating the SVM model.
cats/: Directory containing images of cats.
dogs/: Directory containing images of dogs.

Libraries Used:
OpenCV: Used for image loading and preprocessing.
numpy: For array operations and data manipulation.
scikit-learn: Used for SVM model implementation and evaluation.
matplotlib: For visualization, including confusion matrix plotting.
seaborn: Enhances the visualization of the confusion matrix.

Results:
The SVM model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, effectively distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. This project demonstrates the application of SVM in image classification tasks and provides insights into model performance.
